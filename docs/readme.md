# MPSdoc

MPSdoc is a custom aspect to create documentation for language concepts.
In the aspect a documentation field is available to create documetation 
in the markdown language. The generator of the documentation aspect 
generates markdown documents and an index file. These files can be used to 
generate a static html site with mkdocs.

This is a very premature version to be used as a basis for future use.

# Development
MPSdoc is developed using Jetbrains MPS 2021.2 and is using 
the markdown language from the following github repo:
